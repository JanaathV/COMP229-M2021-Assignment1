        <p class="p1" style="padding-left: 50px; padding-top: 50x;  padding-right: 50px;">My name is Janaath Vjayaseelan
            and I am a student in my third term at Centennial College for the Software Engineering Technician program. I
            reside in Toronto, Canada a
            city booming for technology. My love for technology started at the age of six in 1999 when my dad got me
            this huge bulky box I remember to this day. I would spend hours
            in front of that computer, and eventually started taking it apart, trying to understand how exactly a
            computer worked.</p>

        <p class="p1" style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">Growing up in the rise of the digital era, I was
            always fond of the innovation that was coming out of the space. You'd think with a growing admiration for
            the field
            I would have went to school for engineering. I did the complete opposite, I attended York University for
            Criminology instead. It took a while, but I knew it wasn't
            where I wanted to be. It was when I started working at Best Buy, that I once again discovered that love for
            technology. Since my time working there I made the best
            decision of my life. Attending Centennial College opened me to a world of opportunities. It has given me the
            skill to be the developer I have always wanted to be
        </p>
        <p class="p1" style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;"> I have started building skills in different
            languages. I am able to work with
            Object Oriented Programming, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, SQL, NoSQL. To name a few, have a look at my
            resume that is attached below to get a full list of the skill set I garner.

            On a side-note there is a fun fact that many don't know about me. I not only write code, but I also love to
            writing fiction. I am the author of two fictional novels titled <a
                href="https://www.amazon.ca/Cross-Roads-Pick-Janaath-Vijayaseelan/dp/1792021860/ref=sr_1_1?crid=36AFYFTJ9F9OY&dchild=1&keywords=cross+roads&qid=1622777902&sprefix=cross+raods%2Caps%2C192&sr=8-1">"Cross

            . I guess I didn't want my love for writing to be limited to one sector.
