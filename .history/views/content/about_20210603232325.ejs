            city booming for technology. My love for technology started at the age of six in 1999 when my dad got me this huge bulky box I remember to this day. I would spend hours 
          in front of that computer, and eventually started taking it apart, trying to understand how exactly a computer worked.</p>

          <p>Growing up in the rise of the digital era, I was always fond of the innovation that was coming out of the space. You'd think with a growing admiration for the field
              I would have went to school for engineering. I did the complete opposite, I attended York University for Criminology instead. It took a while, but I knew it wasn't
              where I wanted to be.
