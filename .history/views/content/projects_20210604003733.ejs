    <p class="p1" style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">www.vijaypublications.ca is a project I hold close to me, as a young developer I needed a place to start. I couldn't think of a better way to tie together two of my passions. www.vijaypublications.ca is run on a open source template language called Liquid, it was created by Shopify using Ruby. I have made a few customizations to make the website fall to my liking. However, it is a on going process, and I am looking to build it from the ground up</p>

            <p class="p1" style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">I have always been fond of films, so this cool project caught my attention online. It would be a movie searching web app that would be built using React. There will be a lot of styling using CSS involved as well, which is always a skill I want to refine myself in.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-7">
            <p class="p1" style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">This is another project that I came across online that caught my attention, because instead of React it will be using Angular. I want to be able to diversify my skills and this will present me with that opportunity. Once again there will be a focus in CSS. However the factors that really made this project interesting to me is the chance to work with server-side rendering, beautiful UI, and the fact that the project would be mobile friendly.</p>
