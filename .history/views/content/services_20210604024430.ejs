                <p class="p1" style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">Mobile Use is a standard this day in age, and it isn’t enough to develop websites for desktops. We have to expand on a standard website and make it mobile responsive. If you are someone that is looking to optimize your website for mobile-use or building from the ground up and need the best of both worlds, I’ll be there to help. </p>

                <p class="p1" style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">The pandemic created a boom of new small businesses, and Shopify has been an ecommerce platform that has allowed businesses to thrive. However, the average e-commerce business operator lacks the skills to get into the nitty gritty, and customize their shop to their liking. I have a set of skill in working with Liquid the template created by Shopify for their web development. As an e-commerce user myself, I will be able to help support you from start to finish. </p>
