    <p class="p1" style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">www.vijaypublications.ca is a project I hold close to me, as a young developer I needed a place to start. I couldn't think of a better way to tie together two of my passions. www.vijaypublications.ca is run on a open source template language called Liquid, it was created by Shopify using Ruby. I have made a few customizations to make the website fall to my liking. However, it is a on going process, and I am looking to build it from the ground up</p>
